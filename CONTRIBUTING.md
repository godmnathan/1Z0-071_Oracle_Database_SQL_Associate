## üìã Content Guidelines

### SQL Examples

- Include comments explaining the purpose and functionality
- Use consistent formatting and indentation
- Provide sample output where appropriate
- Use the sample database tables for consistency

Example:
```sql
-- Find employees with salaries higher than their department average
SELECT e.employee_id, e.first_name, e.last_name, e.salary, d.department_name
FROM employees e
JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id
WHERE e.salary > (
    SELECT AVG(salary)
    FROM employees
    WHERE department_id = e.department_id
)
ORDER BY d.department_name, e.salary DESC;
```

### Documentation

- Use clear, concise language
- Break down complex concepts into digestible parts
- Include relevant links to official Oracle documentation
- Use markdown formatting for readability

### Diagrams and Visual Aids

- Use SVG format when possible for better scaling
- Include source files for diagrams (e.g., draw.io XML)
- Provide alt text for accessibility
- Keep file sizes reasonable

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

- Test all SQL examples against Oracle Database 19c or later
- Verify that examples work with the provided sample database
- Check for edge cases and NULL handling
- Ensure examples demonstrate best practices

## üìö Style Guide

- Use consistent naming conventions
  - Table names: singular nouns (e.g., `employee` not `employees`)
  - Column names: lowercase with underscores (e.g., `first_name`)
  - SQL keywords: UPPERCASE (e.g., `SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE`)
- Format SQL for readability:
  - One clause per line for complex queries
  - Consistent indentation (2 or 4 spaces)
  - Align related items vertically when appropriate

## üîÑ Review Process

All contributions will go through a review process:

1. Automated checks for formatting and basic errors
2. Peer review by at least one maintainer
3. Feedback and requested changes if necessary
4. Approval and merge when ready
